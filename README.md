# Airbnb Listings Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb listings data to gain insights into the rental market and identify factors that contribute to successful listings. The analysis follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, which includes data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.

## Introduction

The motivation behind this project is to understand the factors that influence the success of Airbnb listings and provide insights to hosts and potential hosts to optimize their listings. By analyzing various aspects of Airbnb listings, such as pricing, availability, reviews, and keywords, we aim to identify patterns and trends that contribute to high-performing listings.

## Libraries Used

The following libraries were used in this project:

-   pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
-   matplotlib: For data visualization
-   seaborn: For creating attractive and informative statistical graphics
-   wordcloud: For generating word clouds from text data

## Files

The repository contains the following files:

-   `airbnb_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis and visualization
-   `listings.csv`: Dataset containing Airbnb listings information
-   `calendar.csv`: Dataset containing availability and pricing information for Airbnb listings
-   `reviews.csv`: Dataset containing reviews for Airbnb listings
-   `README.md`: Readme file providing an overview of the project

## Analysis

### Data Understanding

The first step in the analysis was to understand the structure and content of the datasets. We explored the `listings.csv`, `calendar.csv`, and `reviews.csv` files to gain insights into the available features and data types. We used the `info()` function to examine the column names, data types, and non-null counts.

### Data Preparation

Before proceeding with the analysis, we performed data cleaning and preprocessing tasks. This included handling missing values, converting data types, and removing irrelevant columns. We also created new features based on the existing data to facilitate further analysis.

### Modeling

We applied various statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze the data and answer specific business questions. Some of the key analyses performed include:

-   Price changes over time: We examined the mean, median, and variance of prices for each listing to identify listings with the highest price variability.
-   Availability analysis: We calculated the availability rate for each listing and identified the least available (most booked) listings.
-   Keyword analysis: We extracted keywords from the listing names and created keyword heatmaps to visualize the most common keywords used in all listings and high-rated listings.
-   Correlation analysis: We explored the correlation between different features and the availability rate to identify factors that influence listing availability.

### Evaluation

We evaluated the results of our analysis by assessing the insights gained and their relevance to the business questions. We compared the keyword frequencies between all listings and high-rated listings to identify any differences in popular keywords. We also examined the correlation coefficients to determine the strength and direction of relationships between variables.

## Results

Through our analysis, we discovered several key findings:

-   Listings with high price variability tend to have seasonal or event-based pricing strategies.
-   The least available listings are often the most popular and frequently booked.
-   High-rated listings tend to use certain keywords more frequently in their names compared to all listings.
-   Factors such as the number of reviews, review scores, and host response rate have a significant correlation with the availability rate of listings.

These insights can help hosts optimize their listings by considering pricing strategies, targeting popular keywords, and focusing on factors that contribute to high occupancy rates.
